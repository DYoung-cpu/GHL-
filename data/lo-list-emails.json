In a nutshell what is going to\nend up happening is we will =E2=80=9CBump=E2=80=9D Lisa=E2=80=99s margin to=\n match Christinas. I\ndon=E2=80=99t know what Lisa=E2=80=99s margins are but you can send them ov=\ner and I will do\nthe math. Here is a sample of how it would work:\n\n\n\nPFN=E2=80=99s Built in Margins for Lisa:\n\n\n\n*Conv:* 50 *FHA:* 100 *Non-QM:* 150\n\n\n\n\n\nPFN=E2=80=99s Built in Margins for Christina:\n\n\n\n*Conv:* 100 *FHA:* 150 *Non-QM:* 200\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we would let lisa know that her margins have all gone up by .50 BPS to\nreflect Christina=E2=80=99s but she will know she has .50BPS built in. Very=\n much\nlike a branch operation, let me know if you want me to work on the break\ndown, just need margins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[image: NMLS 103098] <http://pfnloans.com/>"
