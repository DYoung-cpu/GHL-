I include that on all my files so whomever touches knows\nexactly what I want them to do, no confusion and no mistakes. I am sure you\nalready have something like that in place.  PFN put Danny as a safeguard\nfor Christina=E2=80=99s first few loans, it=E2=80=99s the policy that Jerem=\ny backed and\nfinally decided on.\n\n\n\nI would be happy to speak with everyone and try a determine a time that\nworks for everyone, it will not be Monday. The fact of the matter is that I\ndon=E2=80=99t see what were are going to talk about, right now all manageme=\nnt has\nchimed in and are very much aware of your dissatisfaction.\n\n\n\nThe takeaway for me on this is that we are putting all the resources we\nhave available to assist you with your loans. Anything over and above what\nwe are during right now is not possible, you need to be aware you are not\nthe only loan officer who is having a hard time with the Byte integration.\nCoupled with the fact you have a new hire in Christine, she is still\ngetting the ropes of the new system and staff, I have no doubt in no-time\nat all she will be rocking and rolling.\n\n\n\nAgain, we are asking for your patience Lisa. You currently have 3 people\nassigned to help you, not counting sales support. You need to take\neverything down a notch because simply put, PFN is going through growing\npains.\n\n\n\nA long conversation about how our best at this time is not good enough is\nnot going to accomplish anything. Your loans will close on time, your TBD\napprovals will be worked on and most importantly you have the teams\nsupport. If you feel like you do not have our support then we have to agree\nto disagree.\n\n\n\n\n\n[image: NMLS 103098] <http://pfnloans.com/>\n\n*David Young*\n\n*SVP of Business Development*\n\nP: (818) 223-9999  <(818)223-9999>| D: (818) 936-3800 <(818)936-3800>| C: (=\n310)\n954-7772 <(310)954-7772>\n\nW: *www.priorityfinancial.net <http://www.priorityfinancial.net/>*\n\n*NMLS: 62043*\n\nE: davidyoung@priorityfinancial.net\n\n<https://calendar.app.google/V2GsS9Sh84HjGjv58>\n\n5016 N.
