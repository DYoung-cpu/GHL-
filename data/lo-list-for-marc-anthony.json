To be very clear, I am not resigning from my\nposition. If PFN feels the need to terminate my employment, then you have\nthe right to do so. However, I would like to proceed amicably and would\nappreciate it if you could first provide the full accounting of the amounts\nowed to me so that we can discuss this in a fair and transparent manner.\n\n\nI also want to note that my NMLS license remains active with PFN, and I\ncurrently have loans in the pipeline that need to be managed appropriately.\nWhile I understand the reference to a compliance issue, PFN has been aware\nof my involvement with Lendwise for several months and did not raise any\nobjections until now.\n\n\nFor nearly two years, I have been handling recruitment and have provided\nall necessary information regarding overrides and compensation to Marc,\nyourself, and previously to Anthony when he was president. Despite numerous\nattempts to resolve this matter constructively, it has remained\noutstanding. I hope we can address this properly now.\n\n\nI look forward to resolving this cooperatively.\n\n\n[image: NMLS 103098] <http://pfnloans.com/>\n\n*David Young*\n\n*VP of Business Development*\n\nP: (818) 223-9999  <(818)223-9999>| D: (818) 936-3800 <(818)936-3800>| F: (=\n310)\n954-7772 <(310)954-7772>\n\nW: *www.priorityfinancial.net <http://www.priorityfinancial.net/>*\n\nE: davidyoung@priorityfinancial.net\n\n<https://calendar.app.google/V2GsS9Sh84HjGjv58>\n\n5016 N.
